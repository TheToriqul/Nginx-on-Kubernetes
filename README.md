## 📋 Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of Nginx using Kubernetes Deployment resources, showcasing the power of container orchestration in modern infrastructure. A Deployment in Kubernetes is a higher-level abstraction over a ReplicaSet that provides additional functionality to manage application lifecycles effectively.

Through this project, I've learned how Deployments manage sets of identical pods, ensuring they run and scale as needed while providing sophisticated lifecycle management, including updates and rollbacks. The implementation focuses on creating a production-ready environment with three replicas of Nginx, demonstrating high availability and scalability principles.
